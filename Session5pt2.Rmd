## Part 2: Looping Structures
Great reference: http://r4ds.had.co.nz/iteration.html#for-loop-variations

Iteration is an important aspect of coding because it allows you to repeat operations multiple times without copy-pasting sections of your code within and between files. There are many looping structures available in R, but the most commonly used is the For-loop.

### For-loops

```{r}
output <- vector("double", ncol(Theoph))  # 1. output
for (i in seq_along(Theoph)) {            # 2. sequence
  output[[i]] <- median(Theoph[[i]])      # 3. body
}
output
```

### Three essential components for a for-loop:
* Output
* Sequence
* Body

Other useful function: seq_along(x) is a wrapper for 1:length(x) which catches zero-length vector errors.
